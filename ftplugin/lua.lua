--- Lua is strange, it likes to start its root directory at a lua/ dir
--- However, the init.lua file lives outside of this lua/ dir
--- So, we cannot just find the root by looking upwards for "lua/"
--- If we did this, and started at init.lua, we would never find the root
---
--- The solution is to find the project root by looking upwards for ".git"
--- Then, we check if a ./lua/ dir exists, and if so that becomes our root
--- @param starting_dir string directory to start looking for "lua/"
--- @return string lua_root_dir "lua/" directory if found, otherwise the starting_dir
