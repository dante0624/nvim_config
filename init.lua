-- Add keymap to toggleterm which automatically executes the previous command. Likely <Leader>p
	-- Should be equivalent to opening up toggleterm, hitting up on the arrow key, and then hitting enter

-- Get a basic spellchecker with a dictionary of valid words

-- Look into DAP, Linters, and Formatters
	-- Especially python ones as they may be useful at work

-- Find a way to quicky view all diagnostics and TODOs within a project
	-- Possibly Trouble.nvim

-- Get undotree
