--- @class ServerConfigParams
--- @field root_dir string the found root, or the current file's directory.
--- @field is_single_file boolean true if the root_dir is not part of a project.

--- @class ServerConfig
---
--- command string[] that launches the language server.
--- @field cmd string[]
---
--- Language servers require each project to have a `root` in order to
--- provide features that require cross-file indexing.
---
---	Some servers support a `nil` root directory as a proxy for single
---	file mode under which cross-file features may be degraded. 
---
---	This information came from the LSP Config doc at:
---	https://github.com/neovim/nvim-lspconfig/blob/b1a11b042d015df5b8f7f33aa026e501b639c649/doc/lspconfig.txt#L430
--- @field single_file_support boolean
---
--- Values to pass as `initializationOptions `under `InitializeParams`.
--- See the `initialize` request in the LSP spec.
--- Neovim fills in the rest of the `InitializeParams` by default.
--- @field init_options? lsp.LSPObject
---
--- Values to pass as `settings` under `DidChangeConfigurationParams`.
--- See the `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` notification in the LSP spec.
--- Neovim calls `workspace/didChangeConfiguration` in the callback of
--- `initialize`, only if this is a non-empty table.
--- Many language servers have settings which can only be configured like this.
--- For example:
--- https://github.com/typescript-language-server/typescript-language-server/blob/master/docs/configuration.md
--- This is used for choosing values which the LSP normally finds in
--- a `settings.json` file within the workspace.
--- @field post_init_settings? lsp.LSPObject
---
--- Client-side diagnostic filters.
--- Meant to be used if the server does not support server-side filtering.
--- @field diagnostic_filters? DiagnosticFilters
---
--- Map of language server method names to |lsp-handler|.
--- Defaults to only overwriting `textDocument/publishDiagnostics`
--- to enable the functionality of `diagnostic_filters`.
--- @field server_to_client_handlers? table<string,function>


--- @class DiagnosticFilters
---
--- Client-side diagnostic filter used for normal LSP execution
--- @field normal fun(diagnostic: lsp.Diagnostic):boolean
---
--- Client-side diagnostic Filter used when in "strict" mode of LSP execution
--- @field strict fun(diagnostic: lsp.Diagnostic):boolean
